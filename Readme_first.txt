In Text Classification Project, I worked on '20_newgroups' dataset where dataset contains 20 different classes and 1000 documents in each class.I implemented Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from scratch. 1. Perform Test Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes(already implemented in sklearn). 2. Implement Naive Bayes on your own from scratch for text classification. 3. Compare Results of your implementation of Naive Bayes with one in Sklearn.
